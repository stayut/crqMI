The proposed method can deal with censored quantile regression models with covariates subject to detection limits and  does not require any parametric distribution specification of censored covariates.

The R package "crqMI" requires dependent packages "quantreg", "foreach" and "doSNOW".
Readers can run codes in "example.R" to compare the proposed method with complete case (CC) analysis.
