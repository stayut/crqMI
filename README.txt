The proposed method can deal with censored quantile regression models with covariates subject to detection limits and 
does not require any parametric distribution specification of censored covariates.

The R package "crqMI" requires packages "quantreg", "foreach" and "doSNOW".
After using R to install the package "crqMI" (file "crqMI_0.1.1.tar.gz"), 
readers can run codes in "example.R" to compare the proposed method with complete case (CC) analysis.
